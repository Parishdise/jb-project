# Shiloh Parish and Tatum Corley READ ME

 We, Shiloh Parish and Tatum Corley, are stedents at Madison Academic High School. 
 We have created this website as a project for our Coding I class.
 We decided to build a portfolio website for Julie Bird photograophy, as Julie Bird is a personal frind of Tatum's family and we believe that she deserves much more recognition. 
 Starting out, we didnt know much about where we wanted to go with thsi website stylisticly, but we developed a more asthetically cohesive  design as we went. 
 Origionally, we knew that we wanted more neuteral or earthy colors, as much of Julia's photography is outdoors.
 This very much influenced our design, which we would describe as simple yet classy with calm green colors, that accent the photos well.
 The largest portion of the website is based on photos and their composition, which heavily influenced the code. 
 More than just using the img element to implement the photos, we used center elements to format, and even created a slideshow and interactive lighboxes that make the pictusres larger and allow one to scroll through an album. 
 Making the slideshow was quite a challenge and took up a good bit of time.
 We also hada bit otrouble with the composition, as some things, such as the header, were not formatted the way we wanted.
 For a while there was a blank space on the side of the page. We got through such challenges by editing elements' boxes and double checking the use of columns.
 Another major challenge we faced, this time in the later development of the project, was making the site resposnive.
 We not only had to find ways to make elements sized apporopriatly, but in some cases even had to make certain elements disappear upon resizing the screen and others show up in their place.
 The most challenging page to make resposive would be the "about" page.
 The text would overlap, be misplaced, or even go off screen.
 The picture on the page would be cut off or misplace. We worked trough this by changing the elements in CSS- primarily using the "@media screen" feature.
 Although we are proud of our website, we both know that we have a lot to learn and are eager to continue.
